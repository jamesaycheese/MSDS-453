Assignment Summary

This project is part of an NLP (Natural Language Processing) course and involves gathering and analyzing movie reviews to classify their sentiment. The goal of this assignment is to collect reviews for a specific movie, classify them as either positive or negative, and organize them into a format suitable for further natural language processing analysis.

For this assignment, I selected the movie Top Gun. I gathered 10 reviews from a reputable source, with 5 being positive and 5 being negative. Each review contains at least 500 words to ensure there is enough data for sentiment analysis. The reviews and their associated meta data were stored in CSV files to prepare them for further NLP tasks, such as sentiment classification or text mining.

What This Python File Does

The Python notebook automates the process of preparing the movie reviews and generating two CSV files, which can then be used for NLP analysis:

	1.	Review CSV File: Contains the full text of 10 movie reviews, each labeled as either positive or negative.
	2.	Meta Data CSV File: Contains meta information about each review, such as the movie title, genre, sentiment (positive or negative), and a unique file name for each review.

The key functions of the Python file include:

	•	Processing and storing the reviews and their corresponding meta data.
	•	Automatically labeling reviews with the correct sentiment and saving them in the appropriate format.
	•	Generating two CSV files (one for the reviews, one for the meta data) that can be used in NLP tasks such as text analysis or machine learning model training.

This Python script simplifies the organization of movie reviews into structured data, making it easier to apply NLP techniques for tasks like sentiment analysis, classification, or feature extraction.

The final submission includes:

	•	The Python notebook (.ipynb file) used to generate the CSV files.
	•	Two CSV files: one containing the reviews and one containing the meta data, ready for NLP analysis.
